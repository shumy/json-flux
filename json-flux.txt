 json-flux protocol spec:
  Models: (fire-and-forget, request/response, request/stream, subscribe/channel)
  Command { SEND, REPLY, PUBLISH }
  Flag    { SUBSCRIBE, COMPLETE, CANCEL, ERROR }

 notes:
  1) [id] is always needed to detect lost messages, in case of WS connection resets ?
  2) notation
     (>>)  exactly one message needed
     (<--) zero or more messages of this type
     (|<<, |>>) in a sequence of several messages with pipe, one of them should appear.

 (fire-and-forget)
   Client send a message to an available path, and ignore any reply, error or timeout
   >>  (PUBLISH) 			            [ path, data? ]
 
 (request/reply)
   Client send a message to an available path and waits for a reply, error or timeout
   >>  (SEND) 				            [ id, path, data? ]
   <<  (REPLY, ERROR?) 			      [ id, (data | error)? ]

 (request/stream)
   Client send a message to an available path and waits for a stream subscription reply, error or timeout
   Server publish stream data in a push message model until complete or error message, client also can close the stream prematurely with cancel.
   >>  (SEND) 				            [ id, path, data? ]
   <<  (REPLY, SUBSCRIBE|ERROR) 	[ id, (suid | error) ]
   <-- (PUBLISH) 			            [ id, suid, data ]
   |<< (PUBLISH, COMPLETE|ERROR) 	[ id, suid, error? ]
   |>> (PUBLISH, CANCEL)		      [ suid ]

 (subscribe/channel)
   Client try to subscribe to a channel (producer of continuous messages) and waits for acception, error or timeout.
   Differently from request/stream general errors don't close the subscription, only connection failures!
   Cancel messages from the client or the server can close it.
   >>  (SEND, SUBSCRIBE)		      [ id, path ]
   <<  (REPLY, ERROR?)			      [ id, (suid & data | error) ]
   <-- (PUBLISH, ERROR?) 			    [ id, suid, (data | error) ]
   |<< (PUBLISH, CANCEL) 		      [ id, suid ]
   |>> (PUBLISH, CANCEL)		      [ suid ]

Protocol rules:
  SEND messages always expect a REPLY, in last case a timeout.
  REPLY with success doesn't need an OK flag, it's implicit.
  SUBSCRIBE messages don't have data.

Creation and destruction of channels is not part of the spec, however messages that signal these events are part of the meta-protocol.

    1) use ES6 native Promise
    2) use ES6 Observable proposal
